This is the Coda kernel module as of in Linux-4.14-rc2
with the following patches,

  - Allow for DKMS builds

    Add dkms.conf and kver_compat.h to enable building against different kernel
    versions.

  - coda: fix 'kernel memory exposure attempt' in fsync
    
    When an application called fsync on a file in Coda a small request with
    just the file identifier was allocated, but the declared length was set
    to the size of union of all possible upcall requests.
    
    This bug has been around for a very long time and is now caught by the
    extra checking in usercopy that was introduced in Linux-4.8.
    
    The exposure happens when the Coda cache manager process reads the fsync
    upcall request at which point it is killed. As a result there is nobody
    servicing any further upcalls, trapping any processes that try to access
    the mounted Coda filesystem.


To build this, install dkms on your system and then run.

    dkms add `pwd`
    dkms build coda/6.7
    dkms install coda/6.7

and to remove
    dkms remove coda/6.7 --all
