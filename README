Coda Filesystem: kernel module
==============================

To build a coda.o / coda.ko module for your Linux kernel:
---------------------------------------------------------

For 2.4/2.6 kernels:
- make
- sudo make install

For 2.0/2.2 kernels:
- These haven't been updated for 128-bit file identifiers and other API
  changes (and aren't actively being maintained). They are probably hard
  to build and even when they do they won't work with any current Coda
  client releases.

---------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1: This code should always be newer than or equal to what is in the
	latest official Linux kernel release.

NOTE 2: You only need a kernel module for a Coda client.
